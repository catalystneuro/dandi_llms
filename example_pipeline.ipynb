Here we show that, similar to ALM  neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity  that predicted movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of delay  activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional neglect.  Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete  collapse of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished  thalamic activity. Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in  motor preparation and suggest that persistent activity requires reciprocal  excitation across multiple brain areas.\n",

Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0 (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant, which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems. This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.\n",

      "description: This package contains data, in NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) format, from the 4 mice included in \"Najafi, Farzaneh, Gamaleldin F. Elsayed, Robin Cao, Eftychios Pnevmatikakis, Peter E. Latham, John P. Cunningham, and Anne K. Churchland. \"Excitatory and inhibitory subnetworks are equally selective during decision-making and emerge simultaneously during learning.\" Neuron 105, no. 1 (2020): 165-179.” Each NWB file represents the data and metadata associated with one recording session. In each NWB file, the metadata related to the session (mouse name, session date/time, lab/institution name, etc.) can be found under \"general\". Information related to ROI-segmentation such as ROI mask, ROI type (excitatory or inhibitory), poor or good quality, etc. can be found under \"modules/Image-Segmentation/pln-seg\". Trial information (e.g. start, end times, trial types, trial outcomes, etc.) can be found under \"trials\". Recorded trial-segmented neuronal responses aligned to different time event (e.g. stimulus start, animal choice, etc.) can be found under \"modules/ Trial-based-Segmentation\". A jupyter notebook presenting in detail how to work with NWB files is provided at https://github.com/ttngu207/najafi-2018-nwb/blob/master/notebooks/Najafi-2018_example.ipynb.\n",

This dataset contains electrophysiology recordings of the hippocampus during theta maze exploration in house mice. It includes measurements such as DecompositionSeries, LFP, Units, Position, and ElectricalSeries, which are relevant for studying neuronal activity. The approach used in this dataset includes electrophysiological and behavioral approaches, making it suitable for investigating the effects of caffeine on cerebellar Purkinje cell activity.\n",
